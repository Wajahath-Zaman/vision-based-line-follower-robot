**Project Title:** Vision-Based Line Following Robot using Raspberry Pi

---

### **1. Objective**

To design and implement an autonomous robot capable of detecting and following a black line on the ground using real-time image processing and feedback control (PID) through a Raspberry Pi and camera module.

---

### **2. Introduction and System Overview**

This project involves building a mobile robot that can follow a black line on a white surface. The core idea is to mimic human-like navigation using computer vision. The robot uses a camera (mounted at the front) to capture real-time video feed of the path ahead. The frames are processed using OpenCV to detect the line and calculate deviation from the desired trajectory.

To follow the line, the robot uses a PID controller. The controller continuously calculates the error (distance from the center of the black line), and based on the P, I, and D values, generates control signals to adjust the speed of motors accordingly.

### **3. Hardware Setup and Procedure**

#### **3.1 Component Connections**

* The Raspberry Pi is used as the microcontroller.
* A motor driver (L298N) is connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to control the 4 DC motors.
* The camera module is attached to the Raspberry Pi via the CSI port.
* The robot chassis holds the wheels and motors securely.
* Power is supplied either via power bank or battery pack.

#### **3.2 Installing Operating System**

1. Downloaded Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager.
2. Flashed the OS image to a microSD card (32GB recommended).
3. Inserted the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.
4. Booted into the OS and connected it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

#### **3.3 Coding and Deployment**

1. Installed OpenCV and necessary libraries on the Raspberry Pi using terminal.
2. Wrote the main control code in Python that:

   * Captures video
   * Detects black line using image processing
   * Calculates error
   * Applies PID control to motor speeds
3. Saved the entire program in a single Python script.
4. Created a desktop shortcut to the Python file:

   * Right-clicked on the desktop → New File
   * Entered the command: `python3 line_following.py`
   * Now, clicking the file icon on the desktop executes the full robot control program.

#### **3.4 Communication Between Laptop and Raspberry Pi**

* The Raspberry Pi is connected to a local Wi-Fi network.
* SSH is enabled to allow command line access from the laptop.
* Alternatively, VNC is used for GUI-based remote desktop access.
* Any instruction from the laptop (like starting the program, stopping it, or editing code) is done via this SSH/VNC connection.

### **4. Questions and Answers**

#### Q1. What is the purpose of using a PID controller in this robot?

**A:** PID controller is used to calculate the deviation of the robot from the line. It evaluates the current error, analyzes past errors (Integral), and predicts future error trends (Derivative) to smoothly adjust motor speeds and maintain the robot on the path.

#### Q2. What does the `cv2.imshow()` function do in your code?

**A:** It creates a window to display live output or processed frames, allowing us to see what the robot sees in real time, including the path and detected line.

#### Q3. What is GPIO and how is it used here?

**A:** GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) are the programmable pins on Raspberry Pi. These are used to send control signals to the motor driver. For example, setting a pin HIGH or LOW controls the motor's direction.

#### Q4. What is the role of the motor driver?

**A:** The motor driver acts as a bridge between the low-power control signals from Raspberry Pi and the high-power motors. It amplifies the signal so motors can operate effectively.

#### Q5. What is the function of the camera in this robot?

**A:** The camera captures the front environment like the robot’s eyes and sends frame-by-frame images to the Raspberry Pi. OpenCV processes these frames to detect the line and calculate deviation.

#### Q6. Why not just use the P (Proportional) component alone?

**A:** P alone reacts to current error, but it can cause oscillations or sluggishness. PID adds memory (I) and prediction (D), making the movement smoother and more responsive.

#### Q7. Why do we tune the parameters of PID?

**A:** Tuning helps the robot detect the line more accurately in the specific visible area (like a quadrilateral region of interest) and improves performance.

#### Q8. Why is real-time feedback important in this robot?

**A:** Since the robot moves continuously, it must constantly know its current position relative to the line. Real-time feedback allows it to correct deviations immediately for smooth motion.
