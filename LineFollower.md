# Project Work.

## CLASS MOTOR

- A class is created for all the functions and attributes for motor control. ( A class in python is the blueprint for creating objects. It is a way of bundling the data under one unit. )

1. The first block of code is: 
    ```py
     def __init__(self, EnaA, In1A, In2A, EnaB, In1B, In2B, EnaC, In1C, In2C, EnaD, In1D, In2D):
        # Motor A: Rear Left
        self.EnaA, self.In1A, self.In2A = EnaA, In1A, In2A
        # Motor B: Rear Right
        self.EnaB, self.In1B, self.In2B = EnaB, In1B, In2B
        # Motor C: Front Left
        self.EnaC, self.In1C, self.In2C = EnaC, In1C, In2C
        # Motor D: Front Right
        self.EnaD, self.In1D, self.In2D = EnaD, In1D, In2D

        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
        GPIO.setwarnings(False)
        
        # Setup all pins as OUTPUT
        for pin in [EnaA, In1A, In2A, EnaB, In1B, In2B, EnaC, In1C, In2C, EnaD, In1D, In2D]:
            GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)

        # Initialize PWM for all Enable pins (100 Hz frequency)
        self.pwmA = GPIO.PWM(EnaA, 100)
        self.pwmB = GPIO.PWM(EnaB, 100)
        self.pwmC = GPIO.PWM(EnaC, 100)
        self.pwmD = GPIO.PWM(EnaD, 100)
        
        # Start all PWMs with 0% duty cycle (stopped)
        for pwm in [self.pwmA, self.pwmB, self.pwmC, self.pwmD]:
            pwm.start(0)
    ```

    - This function is constructor function. It gets run automatically when i create a new motor object. like  motors = Motor(5, 6, 13, 19, 26, 21, 12, 16, 20, 25, 23, 24).
    The numbers inside the bracket are the pin numbers from the GPIO board on the respberry pi.
    - Each Dc motor is controlled using three pins, one for current and other two for forward and backward.
    - GPIO is set to Broadcom mode for numbering as per the BCM mode like GPIO17 etc.
    - All the pins are set as output.
    - PWM pulse width modulation used to control the speed of the motor. Inside of sending HIGH(on) or LOW(off) we can control more flexibly.
    - We are defining frequency as 100 to control the motor at different speeds like 25%, 50% etc.
    - We are starting the motor at 0 for each motor.

    VIVA - "The __init__() function sets up all 4 motors by assigning the correct GPIO pins to each one. It sets those pins as OUTPUT, creates PWM objects on the Enable pins to control speed, and starts them at 0% duty cycle. This prepares the Raspberry Pi to send proper speed and direction signals to the motor driver (like L298N)."

2. The second block of code is:
    ```py
    def move(self, speed_percent=0, turn_percent=0, t=0):
        """
        Controls the robot's movement.
        speed_percent: Overall forward/backward speed (-100 to 100).
                       Note: Your PID outputs [-1, 1], so you'll scale that to turn_percent.
        turn_percent: Steering amount (-100 for max left, 100 for max right).
        t: Duration to move (in seconds). If 0, moves indefinitely until new command.
        """
        # Calculate individual motor speeds based on overall speed and turn
        # A positive turn_percent makes the robot turn right (right motor faster, left motor slower)
        # A negative turn_percent makes the robot turn left (left motor faster, right motor slower)
        leftSpeed = speed_percent - turn_percent
        rightSpeed = speed_percent + turn_percent

        # Clamp speeds to valid range (-100 to 100)
        leftSpeed = max(min(leftSpeed, 100), -100)
        rightSpeed = max(min(rightSpeed, 100), -100)

        # Apply speed and direction to each motor
        self._set_motor(self.pwmA, self.In1A, self.In2A, leftSpeed) # Rear Left Motor
        self._set_motor(self.pwmC, self.In1C, self.In2C, leftSpeed) # Front Left Motor
        self._set_motor(self.pwmB, self.In1B, self.In2B, rightSpeed) # Rear Right Motor
        self._set_motor(self.pwmD, self.In1D, self.In2D, rightSpeed) # Front Right Motor

        if t > 0:
            sleep(t)
    ```
    Excellent — this is the **`move` method**, a central function that controls how your robot moves.

    Let me break it down for you step by step:

    ---

    ### 🔧 `def move(self, speed_percent=0, turn_percent=0, t=0):`

    This method allows:

    * **Linear motion** via `speed_percent`
    * **Turning** via `turn_percent`
    * **Time-based motion** via `t` (duration in seconds)

    ---

    ### 📌 Parameters:

    | Parameter       | Description                                                                    |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `speed_percent` | Overall forward/backward motion (-100 to 100). Positive means forward.         |
    | `turn_percent`  | How sharply to turn (-100 to 100). Positive turns right.                       |
    | `t`             | Duration to keep moving. If `0`, the robot keeps going until the next command. |

    ---

    ### 🧠 Logic:

    #### ✅ 1. **Calculate individual motor speeds**

    ```python
    leftSpeed = speed_percent - turn_percent
    rightSpeed = speed_percent + turn_percent
    ```

    * This differential approach makes the robot turn:

    * If `turn_percent` is **positive**, left wheels slow down and right wheels speed up → **turns right**.
    * If `turn_percent` is **negative**, left wheels speed up and right wheels slow down → **turns left**.

    #### ✅ 2. **Clamp values to safe range**

    ```python
    leftSpeed = max(min(leftSpeed, 100), -100)
    rightSpeed = max(min(rightSpeed, 100), -100)
    ```

    * Prevents any value from exceeding the range `[-100, 100]`, which could damage motors or behave unpredictably.

    #### ✅ 3. **Set motor speeds and directions**

    ```python
    self._set_motor(self.pwmA, self.In1A, self.In2A, leftSpeed)  # Rear Left
    self._set_motor(self.pwmC, self.In1C, self.In2C, leftSpeed)  # Front Left
    self._set_motor(self.pwmB, self.In1B, self.In2B, rightSpeed) # Rear Right
    self._set_motor(self.pwmD, self.In1D, self.In2D, rightSpeed) # Front Right
    ```

    * It assumes you have a helper method `_set_motor(pwm, in1, in2, speed)` that:

    * Sets the direction based on whether speed is positive or negative
    * Sets the PWM duty cycle based on speed's magnitude

    #### ✅ 4. **If `t` > 0, move for that duration and stop after**

    ```python
    if t > 0:
        sleep(t)
    ```

    * This delays the program for `t` seconds while the robot is moving.
    * After this point, it’s assumed another command will stop the motors (likely from outside this method).

    ---

    ### 🧪 Example Usage:

    ```python
    robot.move(50, 0, 2)  # Move forward at 50% speed for 2 seconds
    robot.move(30, -20)   # Move forward with a slight left curve indefinitely
    robot.move(0, 100, 1) # Spin in place to the right for 1 second
    ```

    ---

    Would you like to move on to the `_set_motor()` method next? That’s likely the most important helper behind this function.

3. The third block of code is:
    ```py
    def _set_motor(self, pwm, in1, in2, speed):
        """
        Helper function to set individual motor speed and direction.
        This uses the direction logic you provided as working:
        HIGH on in1, LOW on in2 for positive speed (forward).
        """
        GPIO.output(in1, GPIO.HIGH if speed > 0 else GPIO.LOW)
        GPIO.output(in2, GPIO.LOW if speed > 0 else GPIO.HIGH)
        pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(abs(speed))
    ```


    Absolutely! Let’s break it down **slowly and visually**, so you understand **how a single motor is being controlled** with `_set_motor(...)`.

    ---

    ### 🚗 Imagine the Motor

    Every **DC motor** needs two things to work:

    1. **Direction**: Should it spin forward or backward?
    2. **Speed**: How fast should it spin?

    To control this, we use:

    * 2 GPIO pins (`in1`, `in2`) for direction.
    * 1 PWM pin (`pwm`) to control speed.

    ---

    ### 📦 What `_set_motor(...)` Does

    ### It receives:

    * `pwm`: the motor's speed controller.
    * `in1`, `in2`: direction controller wires.
    * `speed`: a number from `-100 to +100`.

    * `+100`: full speed forward.
    * `-50`: half speed backward.
    * `0`: stop the motor.

    ---

    ### 💡 Step-by-Step Explanation

    Let’s go line by line:

    ```python
    GPIO.output(in1, GPIO.HIGH if speed > 0 else GPIO.LOW)
    ```

    * If `speed` is **positive**, set `in1` to **HIGH** (True).
    * If `speed` is **zero or negative**, set `in1` to **LOW** (False).

    ---

    ```python
    GPIO.output(in2, GPIO.LOW if speed > 0 else GPIO.HIGH)
    ```

    * If `speed` is **positive**, set `in2` to **LOW** (False).
    * If `speed` is **negative**, set `in2` to **HIGH** (True).

    🧠 These two lines **together** control **direction**:

    * If `in1 = HIGH` and `in2 = LOW` → **Motor spins forward**
    * If `in1 = LOW` and `in2 = HIGH` → **Motor spins backward**

    ---

    ```python
    pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(abs(speed))
    ```

    * This controls how **fast** the motor should spin.
    * `ChangeDutyCycle(50)` → run motor at 50% speed.
    * We use `abs(speed)` because **PWM cannot take negative values**.

    * Even if you're going backward, you need to give it a **positive number for speed**, and direction is already taken care of.

    ---

    ### 📊 Visual Summary

    | `speed` | `in1` | `in2` | PWM Duty | Result             |
    | ------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | ------------------ |
    | +80     | HIGH  | LOW   | 80%      | Forward, fast      |
    | -50     | LOW   | HIGH  | 50%      | Backward, medium   |
    | 0       | LOW   | HIGH  | 0%       | Stop (no movement) |

    ---

    ### ✅ Final Summary

    * The function **sets the direction** based on whether `speed` is positive or negative.
    * Then it sets **how fast** the motor should spin using PWM.
    * All motors in your robot (4 wheels) use this same function, so it's easy to apply the same logic everywhere.

    ---

    Would you like me to **draw a diagram** showing how this logic flows with forward/backward movement? Or should I move on to how this fits into the full `move()` function?

    Perfect! Let’s now connect everything we just learned to the `move()` function from your `Motor` class.

    ---

    ### 🧠 Goal of `move()`:

    To move the **robot car** in a particular direction by controlling **all 4 motors**.

    ---

    Here’s a simplified version of the function:

    ```python
    def move(self, speeds):
        """
        Moves the robot with the specified motor speeds.
        Expects a list of 4 values: [FL, FR, RL, RR]
        Each value is between -100 and +100
        """
        self._set_motor(self.pwm_FL, self.in1_FL, self.in2_FL, speeds[0])  # Front Left
        self._set_motor(self.pwm_FR, self.in1_FR, self.in2_FR, speeds[1])  # Front Right
        self._set_motor(self.pwm_RL, self.in1_RL, self.in2_RL, speeds[2])  # Rear Left
        self._set_motor(self.pwm_RR, self.in1_RR, self.in2_RR, speeds[3])  # Rear Right
    ```

    ---

    ### 📦 How It Works Step-by-Step

    #### ✅ Step 1: The Input

    You call this method like:

    ```python
    motor.move([80, 80, 80, 80])  # All wheels forward
    ```

    `[80, 80, 80, 80]` means:

    * Front Left → 80% forward
    * Front Right → 80% forward
    * Rear Left → 80% forward
    * Rear Right → 80% forward

    This moves the car **straight forward**.

    ---

    #### ✅ Step 2: Calling `_set_motor(...)` for Each Wheel

    The function calls `_set_motor()` for:

    * Front Left
    * Front Right
    * Rear Left
    * Rear Right

    Each motor gets its corresponding:

    * PWM controller
    * in1 and in2 direction pins
    * speed value

    So this is like:

    ```python
    _set_motor(FL pins, speed 80)
    _set_motor(FR pins, speed 80)
    _set_motor(RL pins, speed 80)
    _set_motor(RR pins, speed 80)
    ```

    And now:

    * Each motor sets the direction (forward or backward)
    * Each motor sets the speed (based on PWM duty cycle)

    ---

    ### 🔄 Some Other Examples

    #### 🔙 Move Backward:

    ```python
    motor.move([-60, -60, -60, -60])
    ```

    All motors will spin in reverse direction at 60% speed.

    #### 🔄 Rotate in Place (Clockwise):

    ```python
    motor.move([80, -80, 80, -80])
    ```

    * Left wheels go forward
    * Right wheels go backward
    Result: Car rotates clockwise in-place.

    ---

    ### ✅ Summary:

    | Part                 | Purpose                                      |
    | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | `move([a, b, c, d])` | High-level command to move the car           |
    | `_set_motor(...)`    | Low-level function to set each wheel         |
    | GPIO & PWM pins      | Physically control motor direction and speed |

    The `move()` function just gives clear movement **instructions** to all 4 motors using the helper `_set_motor(...)`.

    ---

    Would you like to now simulate what happens *physically* when calling different `move()` inputs (like turning, rotating, etc.)? Or should we explore the **stop**, **cleanup**, or other class methods?

4. The fourth block of code is: 
    ```py
    def stop(self):
        """Stops all motors immediately."""
        for pwm in [self.pwmA, self.pwmB, self.pwmC, self.pwmD]:
            pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(0) # Set duty cycle to 0
        # Ensure all input pins are LOW to fully stop/brake motors
        for pin in [self.In1A, self.In2A, self.In1B, self.In2B, self.In1C, self.In2C, self.In1D, self.In2D]:
            GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)

    ```

    Excellent — now we’re looking at the `stop()` method in your `Motor` class.

    Let’s **break it down line by line** to fully understand what happens when `stop()` is called.

    ---

    ### ✅ Purpose of `stop()`

    > To **immediately stop all four motors** (and therefore the robot car).

    ---

    ### 🔍 Full Code

    ```python
    def stop(self):
        """Stops all motors immediately."""
        for pwm in [self.pwmA, self.pwmB, self.pwmC, self.pwmD]:
            pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(0)  # Set duty cycle to 0

        # Ensure all input pins are LOW to fully stop/brake motors
        for pin in [self.In1A, self.In2A, self.In1B, self.In2B, self.In1C, self.In2C, self.In1D, self.In2D]:
            GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)
    ```

    ---

    ### 🧠 Let’s Explain Each Part

    #### 🔸 `for pwm in [...]`

    ```python
    for pwm in [self.pwmA, self.pwmB, self.pwmC, self.pwmD]:
        pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(0)
    ```

    * This loop sets **PWM duty cycle to 0** for all 4 motors.
    * Result: **No power is sent** to the motors ⇒ they stop spinning.

    ---

    #### 🔸 `for pin in [...]`

    ```python
    for pin in [self.In1A, self.In2A, self.In1B, self.In2B, self.In1C, self.In2C, self.In1D, self.In2D]:
        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)
    ```

    * This sets **both direction pins of each motor to LOW**.
    * This is important because:

    * Some motor drivers (like L298N) treat both pins LOW as a **brake**.
    * It **ensures full stop**, not just coasting.

    ---

    ### 📦 In Summary:

    | What It Does                           | Why It’s Done                                    |
    | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | Sets PWM duty cycle of all motors to 0 | Cuts off power to motors                         |
    | Sets all direction pins to `GPIO.LOW`  | Fully stops motors; in many cases, applies brake |

    ---

    ### 🚗 Result:

    The robot comes to an **immediate and full stop**, both electrically and physically.

    ---

5. The fifth block of code is set of 4 function methods:
    ```py
    def move_forward(self, speed_percent=20): # Adjusted for percentage
        self.move(speed_percent, 0, 0)

    def move_backward(self, speed_percent=20): # Adjusted for percentage
        self.move(-speed_percent, 0, 0)

    def turn_left(self, turn_percent=50): # Adjusted for percentage
        self.move(0, -turn_percent, 0)

    def turn_right(self, turn_percent=50): # Adjusted for percentage
        self.move(0, turn_percent, 0)
    ```
    Great! You're now looking at **higher-level movement commands** built on top of the core `move()` function.

    Let’s go through each of these four methods to understand **how they work**, and how they rely on `move()` underneath.

    ---

    ### 🔧 Background: The `move()` Function

    Earlier, you saw that the `move()` function accepts:

    ```python
    def move(self, linear=0, angular=0, correction=0):
    ```

    * `linear`: forward/backward speed (+ forward, – backward)
    * `angular`: turning direction (+ right, – left)
    * `correction`: used for tuning, like PID output

    ---

    ### ✅ Now Let’s Explain Each Function

    ---

    ### 🚗 `move_forward(self, speed_percent=20)`

    ```python
    def move_forward(self, speed_percent=20):
        self.move(speed_percent, 0, 0)
    ```

    * Sends **20% speed forward**, **no turning**, **no correction**.
    * Effectively calls:

    ```python
    self.move(20, 0, 0)
    ```
    * So the robot drives **straight forward**.

    ---

    ### 🔙 `move_backward(self, speed_percent=20)`

    ```python
    def move_backward(self, speed_percent=20):
        self.move(-speed_percent, 0, 0)
    ```

    * Sends **–20% speed**, which means **backward**.
    * Again, no turn or correction.
    * Equivalent to:

    ```python
    self.move(-20, 0, 0)
    ```

    ---

    ### ↩️ `turn_left(self, turn_percent=50)`

    ```python
    def turn_left(self, turn_percent=50):
        self.move(0, -turn_percent, 0)
    ```

    * No forward motion (`0` linear).
    * **Negative angular value** means **left turn**.
    * Equivalent to:

    ```python
    self.move(0, -50, 0)
    ```

    ---

    ### ↪️ `turn_right(self, turn_percent=50)`

    ```python
    def turn_right(self, turn_percent=50):
        self.move(0, turn_percent, 0)
    ```

    * No forward motion, **positive angular value**, so it turns **right**.
    * Equivalent to:

    ```python
    self.move(0, 50, 0)
    ```

    ---

    ### 🧠 Summary Table

    | Function          | Calls `move()` with... | Result               |
    | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
    | `move_forward()`  | `(20, 0, 0)`           | Drives forward       |

## CLASS PID-CONTROLLER

Great—now we move to a crucial part of your line-following robot: the **PID Controller**.

---

### 🧠 What is a PID Controller?

A **PID Controller** is a control system algorithm used to continuously calculate and apply a correction to keep a system on track.
It’s widely used in robotics, drones, temperature control, and especially **line-following robots**.

---

### 🔍 Full Form of PID

* **P** – Proportional
* **I** – Integral
* **D** – Derivative

Each term represents a different strategy to correct the error between a desired value (setpoint) and the actual value (measurement).

---

### 🛤️ Example in a Line-Following Robot

* **Setpoint** = Center of the line
* **Measured value** = Actual position of the robot relative to the line
* **Error** = How far off the robot is from the line center

The PID controller calculates a correction based on:

* **P:** How far off you are (error now)
* **I:** How long you've been off (accumulated past error)
* **D:** How quickly your error is changing (rate of change)

---

### ⚙️ Formula of PID

$$
\text{Output} = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \cdot \int e(t) \, dt + K_d \cdot \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

Where:

* $e(t)$ is the current error
* $K_p, K_i, K_d$ are tuning parameters
* Output is the correction (e.g., motor steering)

---

### 🧠 Intuition for Each Term

| Term               | Purpose                     | Effect                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Proportional ($P$) | Reacts to current error     | Bigger error → stronger correction |
| Integral ($I$)     | Reacts to accumulated error | Fixes slow drift or bias           |
| Derivative ($D$)   | Reacts to error change rate | Dampens overshooting               |

---

1. The first block of code is: 
    ```py
    def __init__(self, kp, ki, kd, output_limits=(-1, 1), integral_limit=None):
        self.kp = kp
        self.ki = ki
        self.kd = kd
        self.output_limits = output_limits
        self.integral_limit = integral_limit

        self.previous_error = 0
        self.integral = 0
        self.last_time = None
    ```
    Great — this is a more flexible and robust version of the PID controller class. Let’s break it down **line by line** so you fully understand what’s happening.

---

    ### 🔧 `__init__` Method of the PID Class

    ```python
    def __init__(self, kp, ki, kd, output_limits=(-1, 1), integral_limit=None):
    ```

    #### ❓What this does:

    This is the **constructor** of the PID controller — it sets up everything the controller needs to function.

    #### 🧩 Parameters:

    * `kp`: Proportional gain
    * `ki`: Integral gain
    * `kd`: Derivative gain
    * `output_limits`: Tuple specifying minimum and maximum output values. This **limits how strong the correction can be**.

    * Default is `(-1, 1)` → e.g., if output correction goes too high/low, it will be clamped.
    * `integral_limit`: Optional. A cap on the integral term to prevent it from growing too large (called **integral windup**).

    ---

    ### 🔍 Variable Initialization Inside the Constructor

    ```python
    self.kp = kp
    self.ki = ki
    self.kd = kd
    ```

    Stores the PID tuning constants so they can be used in the `update()` method.

    ---

    ```python
    self.output_limits = output_limits
    self.integral_limit = integral_limit
    ```

    * These are saved so they can be **applied to clamp** the output and integral value later.
    * This makes the controller more **safe and stable**.

    ---

    ```python
    self.previous_error = 0
    ```

    * Stores the error value from the **previous cycle**.
    * This is needed to calculate the **derivative** (i.e., how quickly the error is changing).

    ---

    ```python
    self.integral = 0
    ```

    * Starts the **integral accumulator** at zero. This will store the **sum of past errors**.

    ---

    ```python
    self.last_time = None
    ```

    * Will be used to calculate `dt` (change in time) during the `update()` method.
    * When the controller is first run, it will set this.

    ---

    ### 🧠 In Summary:

    This constructor sets up:

    * The tuning constants for each PID term
    * Safety limits for the output and integral
    * Memory for previous error and time
    * A structure to compute corrections based on changing error values over time

    ---

    ✅ Let me know when you're ready to move on to the next method: `update()` — the heart of the PID controller logic.

2. The next part of the code is:
    ```py
     def update(self, error, current_time_ms=None):
        """
        Updates the PID controller with the current error.
        current_time_ms should be in milliseconds for consistent dt calculation.
        """
        if current_time_ms is None:
            current_time_ms = time() * 1000 # Convert seconds to milliseconds

        if self.last_time is None:
            self.last_time = current_time_ms
            self.previous_error = error
            self.integral = 0
            return 0.0

        dt = (current_time_ms - self.last_time) / 1000.0 # Convert dt to seconds

        if dt == 0: # Avoid division by zero
            return self.previous_error # Or return 0.0, depending on desired behavior

        P = self.kp * error

        self.integral += error * dt
        if self.integral_limit is not None:
            self.integral = max(min(self.integral, self.integral_limit), -self.integral_limit)
        I = self.ki * self.integral

        derivative = (error - self.previous_error) / dt
        D = self.kd * derivative

        output = P + I + D
        output = max(min(output, self.output_limits[1]), self.output_limits[0])

        self.previous_error = error
        self.last_time = current_time_ms

        return output
    ```


    ### 🔍 Step-by-step Breakdown:

    #### ✅ `def update(self, error, current_time=None):`

    * This function takes the **current error** as input (how far off the robot is from the target).
    * `current_time` is optional; if not provided, it uses `time.time()`.

    ---

    #### ⏱️ `delta_time = current_time - self.last_time`

    * Measures the **time difference** between the last update and now.
    * Needed for computing the integral and derivative.

    ---

    #### 🟢 Proportional (P) Term:

    ```python
    p = self.kp * error
    ```

    * Correction is directly proportional to the error.

    ---

    #### 🔵 Integral (I) Term:

    ```python
    self.integral += error * delta_time
    ```

    * Adds up past errors, scaled by time passed.
    * Prevents **steady-state error**.
    * It's capped using:

    ```python
    self.integral = max(min(self.integral, self.integral_limit), -self.integral_limit)
    ```

    * Prevents **integral windup**.

    ---

    #### 🔴 Derivative (D) Term:

    ```python
    derivative = (error - self.previous_error) / delta_time
    d = self.kd * derivative
    ```

    * Measures **how fast** the error is changing.
    * Helps anticipate and dampen future errors.

    ---

    #### 🧮 Combine All:

    ```python
    output = p + i + d
    ```

    * This is your final control signal, a weighted sum of P, I, and D.

    ---

    #### 🚧 Clamp the output:

    ```python
    output = max(min(output, max_output), min_output)
    ```

    * Ensures the controller doesn't output a value that's too high or low.

    ---

    #### 🧠 Save for next loop:

    ```python
    self.previous_error = error
    self.last_time = current_time
    ```

    ---

    ### ✅ Final Output:

    The method **returns the correction value**, which is typically fed into your motor control system.

    ---

3. The third function in this code is:
    ```py
    def reset(self):
        """Resets the PID controller state."""
        self.previous_error = 0
        self.integral = 0
        self.last_time = None
    ```
    ---

    ### 🔍 Purpose:

    The `reset()` method is used to **clear the internal state** of the PID controller. It's especially useful when:

    * You're restarting a control process (like when the robot is restarted or repositioned).
    * You want to avoid the influence of past errors or accumulated integral values when starting fresh.

    ---

    ### 💡 Breakdown:

    | Line                      | Meaning                                                        |
    | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `self.previous_error = 0` | Removes memory of the last error (so derivative starts fresh). |
    | `self.integral = 0`       | Clears the accumulated integral term.                          |
    | `self.last_time = None`   | Indicates no update has occurred yet after reset.              |

    ---

    ### 🛠 When to Use:

    * After a **manual intervention** in the robot.
    * At the start of a **new control loop**.
    * When there's a **sudden change in setpoint** or **tracking is lost**.

    ---


## VISION AND LANE FOLLOWING LOGIC

1. The first function that is defined is:
    ```py
    def thresholding(img):
    """
    Applies adaptive thresholding and morphological operations to detect a black line.
    (Generally more robust than fixed HSV thresholds for black lines in varying lighting)
    """
    imgGray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    imgBlur = cv2.GaussianBlur(imgGray, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Adaptive thresholding: tune blockSize (odd, e.g., 11, 13, 15) and C (constant subtracted)
    imgThresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(imgBlur, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 10)
    
    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
    imgThresh = cv2.morphologyEx(imgThresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
    imgThresh = cv2.morphologyEx(imgThresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
    
    return imgThresh
    ```
    Excellent — you've now reached the **image processing phase** of the project.

    Let me break down this `thresholding` function in a clear and structured way:

    ---

    ### ✅ **Purpose of `thresholding(img)`**

    This function processes a camera image to extract a **black line** (typically on a white background) using **adaptive thresholding** and **morphological operations**. It converts the image into a binary format where the black line becomes white (foreground) and the rest becomes black (background), making it easier for line-following logic.

    ---

    ### 🔍 **Line-by-Line Explanation**

    ```python
    imgGray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    ```

    * Converts the input **color image** (`BGR`) into **grayscale** (single channel).
    * Simplifies processing — color isn't needed to detect dark lines.

    ---

    ```python
    imgBlur = cv2.GaussianBlur(imgGray, (5, 5), 0)
    ```

    * Applies a **Gaussian blur** to smooth the image and reduce noise.
    * `(5, 5)` is the kernel size, and `0` means auto-calculate standard deviation.
    * Helps avoid false edge detections.

    ---

    ```python
    imgThresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(
        imgBlur, 
        255, 
        cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, 
        cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 
        11, 
        10
    )
    ```

    * This is the **core thresholding** step:

    * `adaptiveThreshold` handles varying lighting conditions better than fixed threshold values.
    * `255`: max value to assign (white).
    * `ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C`: uses the **mean** of neighborhood pixels.
    * `THRESH_BINARY_INV`: inverts result → **black line becomes white**.
    * `11`: block size for local neighborhood (must be odd).
    * `10`: constant subtracted from the mean to fine-tune sensitivity.
    * Result: white line (foreground), black background.

    ---

    ```python
    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
    ```

    * Defines a **3x3 square kernel** for morphological operations.
    * Used to clean up the binary image.

    Morphology means modifying an objects boundaries in an im
    ---

    ```python
    imgThresh = cv2.morphologyEx(imgThresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
    ```

    * **Closing operation**: fills small holes inside white regions (line gaps).

    ```python
    imgThresh = cv2.morphologyEx(imgThresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
    ```

    * **Opening operation**: removes small noise dots in the background.

    ---

    ### 📤 **Return Value**

    ```python
    return imgThresh
    ```

    * Returns the final **binary image** (white line on black background) for further processing like line detection.

    ---

    ### 🧠 Why Adaptive Thresholding?

    * Fixed HSV thresholds can fail when lighting changes.
    * Adaptive thresholding recalculates thresholds locally for each image block, making it **much more robust in real-world environments.**

    ---

    Let me know if you'd like me to:

    * Visualize each step with example images,
    * Explain how this fits into line detection,
    * Or proceed to the next block of code.

2. The second code block is:
    ```py
    def warpImg(img, points, w, h, inv=False):
    """Applies a perspective transform (warp) to an image."""
    pts1 = np.float32(points)
    pts2 = np.float32([[0,0],[w,0],[0,h],[w,h]])
    matrix = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(pts2, pts1) if inv else cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(pts1, pts2)
    return cv2.warpPerspective(img, matrix, (w, h))
    ```

            GPIO.cleanup() # Clean up GPIO pins
            print("Program ended - GPIO cleaned up, resources released.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
    Perfect — going through the `main()` function first gives a big-picture view of how the entire robot system works. Let’s break it down **step by step**, so you understand each concept, even as a beginner.

    ---

    ## 🧠 **Overview of the `main()` Function**

    The `main()` function does five big things:

    1. Sets up the motors and controller.
    2. Connects to the camera and configures it.
    3. Initializes the user interface for control.
    4. Enters a loop to keep processing the camera feed, tracking the line, and controlling the robot.
    5. Handles cleanup on exit.

    ---

    ## 🔹 **1. Motor Setup**

    ```python
    motor = Motor(EnaA=17, In1A=26, In2A=19,  # Rear Left Motor
                EnaB=27, In1B=21, In2B=20,  # Rear Right Motor
                EnaC=10, In1C=18, In2C=22,  # Front Left Motor
                EnaD=9,  In1D=24, In2D=23)  # Front Right Motor
    ```

    * This creates a `Motor` object with specific **GPIO pin numbers**.
    * These pins control **speed** and **direction** of each motor using PWM and logic HIGH/LOW signals.

    > These numbers must match how your physical wires are connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

    ---

    ## 🔹 **2. Controller Setup**

    ```python
    controller = RobotController(motor)
    ```

    * This wraps the `Motor` object with logic to **control the robot** — like starting, stopping, following the line, or responding to key presses.

    ---

    ## 🔹 **3. Camera Setup**

    ```python
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use camera 0 (default USB/webcam)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
    cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 30)
    ```

    * Initializes the webcam.
    * Sets the frame size to 640×480.
    * Tries to get smooth video by limiting the FPS to 30.

    ```python
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error: Could not open camera.")
        GPIO.cleanup()
        return
    ```

    * Checks if the camera was successfully opened. If not, it cleans up and exits.

    ---

    ## 🔹 **4. Interface Setup**

    ```python
    initializeTrackbars([100, 80, 20, 200], wT=480, hT=240)
    create_control_window()
    ```

    * **Trackbars**: sliders to adjust the **perspective transform** visually (so your robot always sees the lane properly).
    * **Control Window**: displays buttons/labels that tell the user what's happening.

    ---

    ## 🔹 **5. User Instructions**

    Just a bunch of `print()` statements that tell the user what keys to press for:

    * Line following
    * Manual driving
    * Emergency stop
    * Quitting

    ---

    ## 🔄 **6. Main Loop: Line Following and Control**

    This runs repeatedly while the robot is active:

    ```python
    while controller.running:
        ret, img = cap.read()  # Get a frame from the camera
    ```

    * Captures an image from the camera.
    * If camera fails, tries to reconnect.

    ```python
    img = cv2.resize(img, (480, 240))
    ```

    * Reduces the image size for faster processing.
    * Same size used in the trackbar-controlled perspective transform.

    ```python
    getLaneCurve(img, controller, display=2)
    ```

    * Processes the image to detect the black line and calculates the **curve/steering angle**.
    * The result is passed to the `controller`, which adjusts motor speed and direction accordingly.

    ```python
    draw_control_interface(controller)
    ```

    * Updates the visual GUI with robot status (mode, speed, etc.).

    ---

    ## ⌨️ **7. Keyboard Input**

    ```python
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    ```

    This listens for key presses:

    | Key    | Action                    |
    | ------ | ------------------------- |
    | `S`    | Start line-following mode |
    | `X`    | Stop everything           |
    | `F`    | Move forward (manual)     |
    | `B`    | Move backward (manual)    |
    | `L`    | Turn left (manual)        |
    | `R`    | Turn right (manual)       |
    | `Q`    | Quit program              |
    | No key | Stop any manual motion    |

    ---

    ## ⚠️ **8. Exit Handling**

    ```python
    finally:
        controller.running = False
        controller.stop_robot()
        cap.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
        GPIO.cleanup()
    ```

    * Ensures the robot stops and resources are released **even if the user presses Ctrl+C or there's an error**.

    ---

## Complete procedure in simple english:
    Sure! Here's a **step-by-step explanation** of how your **vision-based line-following robot works from start to finish**, in simple English:

    ---

    ### 🟢 **1. Start the Robot**

    * When you **power on the Raspberry Pi**, your robot's program begins running.
    * The **camera starts capturing video frames** continuously.

    ---

    ### 📸 **2. Image Processing Begins**

    Each captured frame goes through several steps:

    #### a. **Thresholding (`thresholding(img)` function)**

    * The image is converted to **grayscale** to simplify it.
    * Then, it's **blurred** to reduce noise.
    * Adaptive thresholding is applied to **highlight the black line** (the track) and remove the background.
    * Morphological operations (closing and opening) help **clean up the line** so it's clearly visible.

    #### b. **Warping (`warpImg()` function)**

    * A **bird’s-eye view** of the track is created using perspective transformation.
    * This makes it easier to analyze the line’s position and direction.

    ---

    ### 📐 **3. Line Detection**

    * The processed image is used to **detect the position of the black line** in specific zones of the image (usually near the bottom).
    * A **deviation** is calculated:

    * If the line is in the center, deviation = 0.
    * If the line is more to the left or right, deviation becomes negative or positive accordingly.

    ---

    ### 📊 **4. PID Control is Applied**

    * The **PID controller** receives the deviation as the "error":

    * `P` (Proportional): Corrects based on how far the robot is off-center.
    * `I` (Integral): Corrects slowly over time if there's a consistent drift.
    * `D` (Derivative): Reacts to quick changes (to reduce overshoot or wobbling).
    * The PID controller calculates a **correction value** based on the error.

    ---

    ### ⚙️ **5. Motor Movement (via `Motor` class)**

    * The **correction value from the PID** is sent to the `Motor.move()` function.
    * If the robot is off to the right, the motors on the right slow down and the left side speeds up, causing it to turn left (and vice versa).
    * The robot continuously adjusts its path to stay on the line.

    ---

    ### 🛑 **6. Stopping the Robot**

    * If the robot reaches a goal or you stop the program, the `Motor.stop()` function is called.
    * This sets all motor speeds to 0 and disables their movement.

    ---

    ### ✅ Summary in One Line:

    > Your robot **sees the line**, **processes the image**, **calculates how off it is**, and **corrects itself in real-time using PID control** to follow the line smoothly.

    ---

    Would you like me to now explain how all your components (camera, PID, motor, image functions) are connected in the `main` loop?

    Great! Here's how **all the components—camera, image functions, PID, and motors—are connected in the main loop** of your robot program, explained step by step in **simple English**.

    ---

    ### 🔁 **The Main Loop: Runs Continuously**

    This is the **heart of your program**, where all the components work together **frame by frame**.

    ---

    ### 🧱 1. **Frame Capture from Camera**

    ```python
    _, img = cap.read()
    ```

    * The **camera captures a single frame** from the video.
    * This image is the **starting point** for processing.

    ---

    ### 🎚️ 2. **Image Thresholding**

    ```python
    imgThres = thresholding(img)
    ```

    * You send the captured image to the `thresholding()` function.
    * It returns a **black and white image** where the black line is clearly visible.

    ---

    ### 🧭 3. **Perspective Warp**

    ```python
    imgWarp = warpImg(imgThres, points, wT, hT)
    ```

    * The warped image gives a **top-down view of the track**.
    * This makes it easier to detect the line's position precisely.

    ---

    ### 📍 4. **Finding the Line Position**

    ```python
    middlePoint, imgHist = getHistogram(imgWarp, minPer=0.5, display=True)
    ```

    * This function checks where the **line is located horizontally** in the image.
    * It calculates the **"middlePoint"**, which is the estimated center of the black line in the image.

    ---

    ### 📏 5. **Calculate Deviation**

    ```python
    error = middlePoint - curveCenter
    ```

    * You compare the detected line position with the **center of the robot's view** (`curveCenter`).
    * This gives the **error**—how far the robot is off the track.

    ---

    ### 🧠 6. **PID Control**

    ```python
    pid = PID(Kp, Ki, Kd)
    curve = pid.calculate(error)
    ```

    * The **PID controller** uses the error to compute a **correction value (curve)**.
    * This value tells how much to turn left or right.

    ---

    ### ⚙️ 7. **Motor Adjustment**

    ```python
    motor.move(baseSpeed + curve, baseSpeed - curve)
    ```

    * Based on the curve value, the **motor speeds are adjusted**:

    * If curve > 0 → Turn left
    * If curve < 0 → Turn right
    * If curve = 0 → Go straight

    ---

    ### 🪞 8. **Show Output (Optional)**

    ```python
    cv2.imshow("Path", imgFinal)
    ```

    * The final image with overlays is displayed for debugging or visualization.

    ---

    ### 🕹️ 9. **Loop Repeats**

    * The robot goes back to **step 1 and processes the next frame**.
    * This loop continues as long as the program is running.

    ---

    ### 🔚 **When You Stop the Program**

    ```python
    motor.stop()
    ```

    * Once the loop ends (e.g., with a keyboard interrupt or goal reached), the motors are **stopped** safely.

    ---

    ### 📌 **Visual Summary**

    ```
    [Camera] → [Thresholding] → [Warp Image] → [Find Line Position]
        → [Calculate Error] → [PID Controller] → [Adjust Motors]
    ```

    Each frame goes through this **pipeline in real time**, making your robot **follow the black line smoothly and continuously**.
